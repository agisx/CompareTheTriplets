# [Compare The Triplets](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/compare-the-triplets/problem?isFullScreen=true)

## Problem
Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

The rating for Alice's challenge is the triplet a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]), and the rating for Bob's challenge is the triplet b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).

The task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], and a[2] with b[2].

- If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
- If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
- If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.

Comparison points is the total points a person earned.

Given a and b, determine their respective comparison points.

## Solution
```
static List<int> compareTriplets(List<int> a, List<int> b){
    int tempA = 0, tempB = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < a.Count; i++){
        if (a[i] > b[i]) { tempA++; }       // if alice's point is higher than bob'spoint
        else if (a[i] < b[i]) { tempB++; }  // else if bob's point is higher than alice'spoint
    }
    return new List<int> { tempA, tempB };    
}
```
